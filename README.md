# An embedded nano-position tracking system. 
This repository includes the instructions to create an embedded real-time nano-position tracking system by detecting the reflected light a linear CCD sensor (TCD1304, Toshiba). The instruction includes a detailed schematic on hardware implementation and the code to drive TCD1304.
